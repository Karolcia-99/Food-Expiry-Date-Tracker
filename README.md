# Food-Expiry-Date-Tracker
The Food Expiry Date Tracker is an application that allows users to keep track of the expiration dates of their food items.

The application allows users to input the name of a food item and select an expiration date using a date picker. Once added, the food item will appear in a list, along with the number of days remaining until the item expires.

The app will help users to avoid food waste and keep their food inventory organized by constantly reminding them of the expiration dates of their food items.
